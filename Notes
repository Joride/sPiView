APNS cert handling:

1. get a cert via the dev portal (see: "Establishing a Certificate-Based Connection to APNs", https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/establishing_a_certificate-based_connection_to_apns)
2. import into keychain access by doubleclicking it
3. select the certificate AND the private key and export that as a .p12 file
4. in terminal, create a .pem file from the p12 using this commmand:
openssl pkcs12 -in /path/to/cert.p12 -out /path/to/cert.pem -nodes -clcerts
5. Update the the Python project with the proper device token and path the the .pem -file
6. Run the Python file
